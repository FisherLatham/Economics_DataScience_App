# Economics_DataScience_App
Welcome to my Economics vs. Data Science Project! This Shiny app takes you through each stage of my process, besides the data cleaning of course 😃 The first tab, Exploring the Data, lets you visualize the Google Trends data for Data Science hits and Economic hits. 👊 The second tab, Forecast Data Science, lets you follow the rationale and progression for each forecasting model. 😎 Finally, the third tab, Understanding Economics, allows you to delve into the relationship between Data Science and Economics and predict and forecast Economics hits using lagged values. 🤯 You can check out the Shiny App this code creates using the link: https://fisher-latham.shinyapps.io/Economics_DataScience_App/
