# Economics_DataScience_App
Welcome to my Economics vs. Data Science Project! This Shinyapp takes you through each stage of my process, besides the data cleaning of course ðŸ˜ƒ
The first tab, Exploring the Data, let's you visualize the Google Trends data for Data Science hits and Econmic hits. ðŸ‘Š
The second tab, Forecast Data Science, let's you follow the rational and progression for each forecasting model. ðŸ˜Ž
Finally, the third tab, Understanding Economics, allows you to delve into the relationship between Data Science and Economics, along with predicting and forecasting Economics hits using lagged values. ðŸ¤¯
